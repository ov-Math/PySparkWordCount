this is an example of a text file
so spark can count its lines
it contains a lot of lines
or at least it should
but it is kinda small tho
my bad
it is because I am really lazy right now
just like spark is
don't want to type anymore
neither go search any doc online on the internet
I really don't know what to type here anymore
hope you are not reading this
shame on me
I think it iss enough now
this is the end of the example text file
